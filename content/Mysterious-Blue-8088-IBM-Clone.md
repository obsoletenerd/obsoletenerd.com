Title: Mysterious Blue 8088 IBM Clone

Summary: I stumbled on this all-blue IBM PC XT clone that I haven't been able to find any information about, no matter how much I dig online. The only identifying label is on the bottom of the keyboard, which was made by Nan Tan Computer Co in Taiwan, but there is no record of them ever making desktop PCs. The keyboard is the exact same blue as the rest of the PC so was clearly along with the rest of the machine.

*This is one of a series of blog posts about retro technology that I have collected over the years, under the [Museum](https://obsoletenerd.com/tag/museum) tag. These will be "live articles" that I update over time as I learn more about the piece of tech, or do work restoring/fixing/updating it.

I stumbled on this all-blue IBM PC XT clone that I haven't been able to find any information about, no matter how much I dig online. The only identifying label is on the bottom of the keyboard, which was made by Nan Tan Computer Co in Taiwan, but there is no record of them ever making desktop PCs. The keyboard is the exact same blue as the rest of the PC so was clearly along with the rest of the machine.

I don't want to try boot it up until i've fully checked it over, especially considering the age of the machine and the potential for bad caps or corrosion. I gave it a quick clean, but plan on going over it properly soon then seeing if I can get it to work.

For now, here's some photos and the basic info i've gleaned from it.

## Specifications

It has a [Seagate ST-389](https://theretroweb.com/harddrives/238) HDD inside it, which is a 32Mb 3600RPM dual-platter hard drive.

Inside is a [Siemens SAB 8088-1-P](https://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/8088/Siemens-SAB8088-1-P.html) CPU, running a whopping 10MHz clock speed. To put that in perspective, the chip inside your tap-to-pay/paypass bank card is 7x faster than this computer.

The decal on the bottom of the keyboard has the following information:

> NAN TAN COMPUTER CO.

> FCC 1D: FMA44HKB6251

> MADE IN TAIWAN

and

> MANUFACTURED

> BY NTC CO.

> MODEL NO. KB-6251EM FOR 8088

> & 80286

> ENHANCED 101 KEYS

The [FCC application](https://fccid.io/FMA44HKB6251) just confirms the keyboard was made by Nan Tan Co, but doesn't really give up anything extra.
