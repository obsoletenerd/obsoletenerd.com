Title: Games
---

Below are some games I've developed over the years. None of them are anything special, and are mostly just weekend projects to experiment with a specific game engine or create a game my kids asked for. I have contributed work to more "proper" games in the past, but never really my own ideas and only as contracted asset artist, but I do enjoy game development in general and tinkering on little games like these below.

## Games playable in the browser

[Lander2000](/pages/lander2000/) is a re-make of the old Lunar Lander classic made in [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). This one is a "complete" game with dynamically generated levels, high scores, etc. This was the first PICO-8 game I "published", putting it on the [official BBS](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=143508) which means it's now available on all PICO-8 systems if you search for it.

[Beltalowda](/pages/beltalowda/) is a space exploration/mining game also being developed in [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). Very early development, you can fly around and shoot asteroids and collect ore, but not much more yet. I'm planning to add selling of ores, processing for fuel, buying upgrades, etc.

[Snack](/pages/snack/) is based on the old Snake game that came with Nokia phones, and in which I lost way too many hundreds (thousands?) of hours of my life to. I merged the idea with the fruit/gem matching games of the early 2000s, so now eating fruit makes you longer, but eating the same fruit you just ate makes you shorter. This game is still in early development, and I plan on adding special fruits etc, of which there is currently 1 (Chilli).

[Scorched Universe](/pages/scorched-universe/) is similar to the old Scorched Earth games where you aim projectiles that take trajectory/angle/gravity into account, but in this case your goal is to clear the solar system of the pesky asteroids. This is a very early state for this game, and the actual goals are much bigger (more like scorched earth with a player on each planet, obstacles to avoid, different weapons, etc) but I whipped this up mostly to play with trajectory lines and gravity systems.


## Games not playable in the browser (yet?)

[TypeJump](https://github.com/obsoletenerd/typejump) is a small game I made in [Game Maker Studio 2](https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/introducing-gamemaker-studio-2) (a deceptively more powerful/advanced game engine than the name makes it sound) for my girls when they were very young, to introduce them to computers and how keyboards/typing works. It's like a typing-tutor type game but much simpler, purely having them find individual keys on the keyboard to get the character to jump obstacles. I've also been slowly working on a new version of this game that is much more advanced and is a proper typing tutor with dictionary words/phrases, advancing difficulty, timers/leaderboards, etc.

[Earth Defender](https://github.com/obsoletenerd/earth-defender) was the first game I made in [Game Maker Studio 2](https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/introducing-gamemaker-studio-2) just to learn the engine, and because my kids wanted a "game like Asteroids but with better graphics". I built this in tandem with them looking over my shoulder, describing how things needed to look etc. It's a very simple clone and not really worth downloading/playing, but putting it here for history's sake. The "sequel" is **Beltalowda** above which takes the idea further and is playable in the browser.
