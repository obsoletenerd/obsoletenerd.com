Some games I've made that have been exported to work in the browser, so you can play them below...

## PICO-8 Games

[Lander2000](/pages/lander2000/) is a re-make of the old Lunar Lander classic. This one is a "complete" game with dynamically generated levels, high scores, etc. This was the first PICO-8 game I "published", putting it on the [official BBS](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=143508) which means it's now available on all PICO-8 systems if you search for it.

[Beltalowda](/pages/beltalowda/) is a space exploration/mining game. Very early development, you can fly around and shoot asteroids and collect ore, but not much more yet. I'm planning to add selling of ores, processing for fuel, buying upgrades, etc.
