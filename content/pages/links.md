In the spirit of the old-web, this is my curated directory of links to websites I find useful or interesting. Almost all of the websites here are personal sites/projects by individuals or small teams done for the love of it.

## Retrocomputing

[DOS Haven](https://www.doshaven.eu) is a directory of hundreds of new (yes *new*) DOS games and homebrew.

[TheOldNet](https://theoldnet.com) is a site that lets you view websites as they were in the 90s, along with a whole bunch of other retrocomputing tools and resources.

## Interesting Personal Blogs

[Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski) is a personal blog doing deep-dives on random topics from gears and watches to naval architecture and GPS. Each post is a meticulously hand-crafted adventure with incredible depth, detail, and interactice diagrams.

[Leonard David](https://www.leonarddavid.com) has been writing about space for longer than I've been alive. Other than writing multiple physical books, he writes blog posts relentlessly on all things space-news-related.

## Interactive/Entertainment

[Windows93.net](https://www.windows93.net) is half Windows 95 parody site, and half interactive web-based exploration of retro awesomeness. There's is *so much* stuff hidden in here if you start digging.

[Hackers Curator](https://hackerscurator.com) is a good-old early-web style fan-page to the movie Hackers, made by a passionate fan who creates replica props and collects memorabilia related to the movie. As a mega-fan myself with an unhealthy collection of Hackers-related crap, I'm a fan of this fan.

[Low-tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com) has been running since 2007 and is a great place to kill some time reading long-form articles about using low-tech solutions to modern environmental/sustainability problems.

[Paged Out!](https://pagedout.institute) is an online technical magazine dedicated to programming, hacking/infosec, retro computing, and general tech-nerd culture. It works on the idea of "1 page = 1 article" with the articles all submitted by the community.
