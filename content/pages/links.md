In the spirit of the old-web, this is my curated directory of links to websites I find useful or interesting. Almost all of the websites here are personal sites/projects by individuals or small teams done for the love of it.

## Making & Hacking

[Hackerspace.au](https://hackerspace.au/) - A Mastadon social instance run by the [Ballarat Hackerspace](https://ballarathackerspace.org.au) letting you connect to the fediverse.

[The Hacker Crackdown](https://www.mit.edu/hacker/hacker.html) - MIT has been hosting this digital copy of The Hacker Crackdown by Bruce Sterling for many decades. If you're into early computer culture this is basically one of the bibles.

[Phrack](https://phrack.org) - Somehow still going after all these decades, and still posting a broad range of technical deep-dives into very random topics. Almost always over my head, but still a good read if only to learn random new stuff about things that will never be relevant to you.

[PoC||GTFO]() - "International Journal of Proof of Concept or Get the Fuck Out" is "a friendly little journal for ladies and gentlemen of distinguished ability and taste in the field of computer security and the architecture of weird machines." Following the likes of Phrack or Uninformed but taking a pseudo-biblical approach to long-form computer-security essays.

## Retrocomputing

[DOS Haven](https://www.doshaven.eu) - A directory of hundreds of new (yes *new*) DOS games and homebrew.

[TheOldNet](https://theoldnet.com) - A website that lets you view other websites as they were in the 90s, along with a whole bunch of other retrocomputing tools and resources. One of my favourite tools is the [browser proxy](https://theoldnet.com/docs/httpproxy/index.html) letting you set your browser to a specific year and all websites will appear as they existed in that year. Great for browsing from an actual retro computer.

[The Oldternet](https://www.geocities.ws/oldternet/) - A personal website that is a love-letter to the early internet and video game consoles. Lots of cool old icon packs, video game console ads and promo material, and the all-import webring.

[EFF's (Extended) Guide to the Internet](https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/eegtti/eeg_toc.html) - Yes, *that* EFF... this is their "Extended Guide to the Internet" originally published in 1994. It's a great nostalgia trip to a time before search engines or wikipedia, where people would try and collect as much information as possible in one place just to help other people find their way around the (then very very small) internet.

<a id="personal-blogs"></a>
## Personal Blogs

[Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski) - A personal blog doing deep-dives on random topics from gears and watches to naval architecture and GPS. Each post is a meticulously hand-crafted adventure with incredible depth, detail, and interactice diagrams.

[Leonard David](https://www.leonarddavid.com) - Writing interesting articles about space for longer than I've been alive. Other than writing multiple physical books, he writes blog posts relentlessly on all things space-news-related.

[Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog) - Quite the famous nerd these days, and still keeps a very well written blog parallel to his YouTube videos. His blog posts generally go into a lot more technical detail too, with code and tutorials included rather than just a "mainstream audience" focussed overview like the videos.



<a id="interactive-entertainment"></a>
## Interactive/Entertainment

[Windows93.net](https://www.windows93.net) - Half Windows 95 parody site, and half interactive web-based exploration of retro awesomeness. There's is *so much* stuff hidden in here if you start digging.

[Beyond Cyberpunk!](http://www.streettech.com/bcp/) - Existing since before the web itself and originally starting as a HyperCard, this is a love-letter to Cyberpunk (the genre before the game existed) and everything relating to it. Essays, links/resources, and lots more.

[Hackers Curator](https://hackerscurator.com) - A good-old early-web style fan-page to the movie Hackers, made by a passionate fan who creates replica props and collects memorabilia related to the movie. As a mega-fan myself with an unhealthy collection of Hackers-related crap, I'm a fan of this fan.

[Low-tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com) - Running since 2007, it's a great place to kill some time reading long-form articles about using low-tech solutions to modern environmental/sustainability problems.

[Paged Out!](https://pagedout.institute) - An online technical magazine dedicated to programming, hacking/infosec, retro computing, and general tech-nerd culture. It works on the idea of "1 page = 1 article" with the articles all submitted by the community.

[Rotten Library](https://gwern.net/doc/rotten.com/library/index.html) - "An unforgettable collection of all that mankind swore to forget, but which we have trapped in agonizing clarity to remember always". A massive archive of articles covering every conceivable topic, with zero hesitation to go where more mainstream websites might shy away from.

[Atomic Rockets](https://projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/) - The personal project of a single person that has to be one of the most comprehensive resources of Science Fiction information/facts/data ever attempted. If you're a Sci-Fi author or just a keen fan, this website is a mind-blowing example of how far a personal hobby website can go.

## Indexes & Directories

[Gossip's Web](https://gossipsweb.net) - A handmade directory of handmade websites. Like this links page but with orders of magnitude more content and better organisation.

[The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com) - Directory of extremely random web creations by individuals who submit their projects to the list, and then you can click to see a random project by someone. Basically an art experiment in front-end web design and user interaction.

[Cameron's World](https://www.cameronsworld.net) - An epic trip down Geocities-era memory lane. Meticulously crafted anti-minimalism homepage made to look like a digital scrapbook of 90s GIFs and backgrounds, scattered with links to random archived Geocities homepages. Dig around, there's treasure galore.

[Wiby](https://wiby.org) - Search engine for personal websites, focussing on oldweb/indieweb style hobbyist/fan pages. Click the "surprise me" button to get some examples.

[Ooh.Directory](https://ooh.directory) - A directory of 2,000+ blogs collated in the style of early Yahoo, completely with categories/sub-categories, search, and "go to a random blog" functions. A personal project of a single person.
