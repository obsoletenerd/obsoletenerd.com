In the spirit of the old-web, this is my curated directory of links to websites I find useful or interesting. Almost all of the websites here are personal sites/projects by individuals or small teams done for the love of it.

## Making & Hacking

[Hackerspace.au](https://hackerspace.au/) - A Mastadon social instance run by the [Ballarat Hackerspace](https://ballarathackerspace.org.au) letting you connect to the fediverse.

[The Hacker Crackdown](https://www.mit.edu/hacker/hacker.html) - MIT has been hosting this digital copy of The Hacker Crackdown by Bruce Sterling for many decades. If you're into early computer culture this is basically one of the bibles.

[Phrack](https://phrack.org) - Somehow still going after all these decades, and still posting a broad range of technical deep-dives into very random topics. Almost always over my head, but still a good read if only to learn random new stuff about things that will never be relevant to you.

[PoC||GTFO]() - "International Journal of Proof of Concept or Get the Fuck Out" is "a friendly little journal for ladies and gentlemen of distinguished ability and taste in the field of computer security and the architecture of weird machines." Following the likes of Phrack or Uninformed but taking a pseudo-biblical approach to long-form computer-security essays.

## Retrocomputing

[DOS Haven](https://www.doshaven.eu) - A directory of hundreds of new (yes *new*) DOS games and homebrew.

[TheOldNet](https://theoldnet.com) - A website that lets you view other websites as they were in the 90s, along with a whole bunch of other retrocomputing tools and resources. One of my favourite tools is the [browser proxy](https://theoldnet.com/docs/httpproxy/index.html) letting you set your browser to a specific year and all websites will appear as they existed in that year. Great for browsing from an actual retro computer.

## Personal Blogs

[Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski) - A personal blog doing deep-dives on random topics from gears and watches to naval architecture and GPS. Each post is a meticulously hand-crafted adventure with incredible depth, detail, and interactice diagrams.

[Leonard David](https://www.leonarddavid.com) - Writing interesting articles about space for longer than I've been alive. Other than writing multiple physical books, he writes blog posts relentlessly on all things space-news-related.

## Interactive/Entertainment

[Windows93.net](https://www.windows93.net) - Half Windows 95 parody site, and half interactive web-based exploration of retro awesomeness. There's is *so much* stuff hidden in here if you start digging.

[Hackers Curator](https://hackerscurator.com) - A good-old early-web style fan-page to the movie Hackers, made by a passionate fan who creates replica props and collects memorabilia related to the movie. As a mega-fan myself with an unhealthy collection of Hackers-related crap, I'm a fan of this fan.

[Low-tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com) - Running since 2007, it's a great place to kill some time reading long-form articles about using low-tech solutions to modern environmental/sustainability problems.

[Paged Out!](https://pagedout.institute) - An online technical magazine dedicated to programming, hacking/infosec, retro computing, and general tech-nerd culture. It works on the idea of "1 page = 1 article" with the articles all submitted by the community.

[Rotten Library](https://gwern.net/doc/rotten.com/library/index.html) - "An unforgettable collection of all that mankind swore to forget, but which we have trapped in agonizing clarity to remember always". A massive archive of articles covering every conceivable topic, with zero hesitation to go where more mainstream websites might shy away from.

## Indexes & Directories

[Gossip's Web](https://gossipsweb.net) - A handmade directory of handmade websites. Like this links page but with orders of magnitude more content and better organisation.
