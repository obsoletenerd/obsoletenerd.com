In the spirit of the old-web, this is my curated directory of links to websites I find useful, interesting, or worth sharing. A lot of the websites here are personal sites/projects by individuals or small teams done for the love of it, or are websites that deserve more attention in this modern era of megacorps buying all the online attention.

<a id="making-and-hacking"></a>
## Making & Hacking

Websites devoted to the traditional meaning of the word [Hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture). Pulling things apart to see how they work. Breaking things to learn how they were made. Creating things for no other reason than to enjoy the act of creation.

[Hackerspace.au](https://hackerspace.au/) - A Mastodon social instance run by the [Ballarat Hackerspace](https://ballarathackerspace.org.au) letting you connect to the fediverse.

[The Hacker Crackdown](https://www.mit.edu/hacker/hacker.html) - MIT has been hosting this digital copy of The Hacker Crackdown by Bruce Sterling for many decades. If you're into early computer culture this is basically one of the bibles.

[Phrack](https://phrack.org) - Somehow still going after all these decades, and still posting a broad range of technical deep-dives into very random topics. Almost always over my head, but still a good read if only to learn random new stuff about things that will never be relevant to you.

[PoC||GTFO](https://pocorgtfo.hacke.rs) - "International Journal of Proof of Concept or Get the Fuck Out" is "a friendly little journal for ladies and gentlemen of distinguished ability and taste in the field of computer security and the architecture of weird machines." Following the likes of Phrack or Uninformed but taking a pseudo-biblical approach to long-form computer-security essays. Another archived copy [here](https://github.com/angea/pocorgtfo).

<a id="retrocomputing"></a>
## Retrocomputing

All things [retrocomputing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocomputing). Yes, apparently it's one word now. Whether it's early-internet culture, video game consoles or archaic home computers, these are the pages that store information relevant to [my unhealthy obsession](https://obsoletenerd.com/tag/museum) with collecting other people's e-waste.

[DOS Haven](https://www.doshaven.eu) - A directory of hundreds of new (yes *new*) DOS games and homebrew.

[TheOldNet](https://theoldnet.com) - A website that lets you view other websites as they were in the 90s, along with a whole bunch of other retrocomputing tools and resources. One of my favourite tools is the [browser proxy](https://theoldnet.com/docs/httpproxy/index.html) letting you set your browser to a specific year and all websites will appear as they existed in that year. Great for browsing from an actual retro computer.

[The Oldternet](https://www.geocities.ws/oldternet/) - A personal website that is a love-letter to the early internet and video game consoles. Lots of cool old icon packs, video game console ads and promo material, and the all-import webring.

[EFF's (Extended) Guide to the Internet](https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/eegtti/eeg_toc.html) - Yes, *that* EFF... this is their "Extended Guide to the Internet" originally published in 1994. It's a great nostalgia trip to a time before search engines or wikipedia, where people would try and collect as much information as possible in one place just to help other people find their way around the (then very very small) internet.

[Vogons](https://www.vogons.org) - A community/forum for people into emulating old software (on all types of hardware). Retro arcade and video game consoles, PC/mac emulation, and everything related to those things.

[Infinite Mac](https://infinitemac.org) - Emulate classic Macintosh operating systems directly in your browser. Everything from the original System 1.0 release in 1984 up to 2005's Mac OSX Tiger when Spotlight was introduced and most people are familiar with from the see-through G3 bubble-iMacs at school.

[ClassicReload](https://classicreload.com) - Classic video games emulated in the browser, no installation of anything required. It doesn't have ever game ever, but it has lots of classics I personally grew up playing like [After Burner II](https://classicreload.com/dosx-after-burner-ii.html), [Prince of Persia](https://classicreload.com/prince-of-persia.html), [Wolfenstein 3D](https://classicreload.com/wolfenstein-3d.html), and [TMNT II](https://classicreload.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-ii-the-arcade-game.html)

[The Oldschool PC Font Resource](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/) - The world's biggest collection of classic text mode fonts, system fonts and BIOS fonts from DOS-era IBM PCs and compatibles - preserving raster typography from pre-GUI times.

<a id="personal-blogs"></a>
## Personal Blogs

Interesting personal blogs from interesting individuals on interesting topics, or just blogs from individuals on topics. The "interesting" part is subjective but these are the personal blogs I follow from people who write about stuff that interests me personally.

[Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski) - A personal blog doing deep-dives on random topics from gears and watches to naval architecture and GPS. Each post is a meticulously hand-crafted adventure with incredible depth, detail, and interactive diagrams.

[Leonard David](https://www.leonarddavid.com) - Writing interesting articles about space for longer than I've been alive. Other than writing multiple physical books, he writes blog posts relentlessly on all things space-news-related.

[Localghost](https://localghost.dev/) - Personal site of another web person who came up through the geocities trenches. I love the theme-switcher (top right) showing various old design trends, and especially enjoyed the [love letter to the personal website](https://localghost.dev/blog/this-page-is-under-construction/) blog entry.

[Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog) - Quite the famous nerd these days, and still keeps a very well written blog parallel to his YouTube videos. His blog posts generally go into a lot more technical detail too, with code and tutorials included rather than just a "mainstream audience" focussed overview like the videos.

[Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com) - A renowned cryptography and security expert who has been writing about computer security since the 90s, and has published multiple books on the topic too.

[The Digital Antiquarian](https://www.filfre.net/) - Jimmy has been writing about retro video games for a long time, and has an awesome collection of articles going into the history, development, and culture of them. It's best to use the [sitemap](https://www.filfre.net/sitemap/) to get a list of articles chronologically.

<a id="old-websites"></a>
## Old Websites Still Running

[First Website Ever](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) - Quite literally the first webpage ever made, still hosted on the CERN servers where the World Wide Web started. The inspiration for this very website design and the peak of web design in general.

[Starship Titanic](https://starshiptitanic.com) - The original website for the Starship Titanic game made by Douglas Adams, of which I loved dearly and still own my original copy. Most of the downloadable assets (wallpapers, WAV files) now 404 but the page content is still there. The company behind it which was started/owned by Adams, called [The Digital Village](https://www.tdv.com), is also still online despite going defunct in 2001.


<a id="interactive-entertainment"></a>
## Interactive/Entertainment

These are websites designed to entertain, educate, or archive. The topics vary wildly but all of the below websites are places I've found informative or entertaining in some way.

[Windows93.net](https://www.windows93.net) - Half Windows 95 parody site, and half interactive web-based exploration of retro awesomeness. There is *so much* stuff hidden in here if you start digging.

[Beyond Cyberpunk!](http://www.streettech.com/bcp/) - Existing since before the web itself and originally starting as a HyperCard, this is a love-letter to Cyberpunk (the genre before the game existed) and everything relating to it. Essays, links/resources, and lots more.

[Hackers Curator](https://hackerscurator.com) - A good-old early-web style fan-page to the movie Hackers, made by a passionate fan who creates replica props and collects memorabilia related to the movie. As a mega-fan myself with an unhealthy collection of Hackers-related crap, I'm a fan of this fan.

[Low-tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com) - Running since 2007, it's a great place to kill some time reading long-form articles about using low-tech solutions to modern environmental/sustainability problems.

[Paged Out!](https://pagedout.institute) - An online technical magazine dedicated to programming, hacking/infosec, retro computing, and general tech-nerd culture. It works on the idea of "1 page = 1 article" with the articles all submitted by the community.

[Rotten Library](https://gwern.net/doc/rotten.com/library/index.html) - "An unforgettable collection of all that mankind swore to forget, but which we have trapped in agonizing clarity to remember always". A massive archive of articles covering every conceivable topic, with zero hesitation to go where more mainstream websites might shy away from.

[Atomic Rockets](https://projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/) - The personal project of a single person that has to be one of the most comprehensive resources of Science Fiction information/facts/data ever attempted. If you're a Sci-Fi author or just a keen fan, this website is a mind-blowing example of how far a personal hobby website can go.

[Ian's Shoelace Site](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/index.htm) - Ian has been collecting information about shoe laces and all the ways to lace or tie shoes and posting it on the web since April 2000, and this has to be one of my favourite examples of the old-web. A lifetime devoted to sharing information about one of the most random topics, and yet still valuable and useful to this current day.

[Apollo Lunar Surface Journal](https://www.nasa.gov/history/alsj/main.html) - An absolute gem of the early web, this is an *extremely* comprehensive collection of information about the Apollo Lunar Surface Journeys, including transcripts, photographs, and technical data, scanned trainined guides, audio recordings, and so much more. First published in 1995, this is such a valuable resource for space enthusiasts.

[Higher Intellect](https://preterhuman.net) - Started in the late 1990s, Higher Intellect is a colossal collection of text files and PDFs on every topic imaginable. Data hoarding as a service-to-humanity. This is one of those websites you want stored on your NAS for when society collapses.

<a id="indexes-and-directories"></a>
## Indexes & Directories

Old-school web directories and curated lists made by people who want to share the best of the indie-web without the influence of algorithms and advertiser-funded bias.

[Gossip's Web](https://gossipsweb.net) - A handmade directory of handmade websites. Like this links page but with orders of magnitude more content and better organisation.

[The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com) - Directory of extremely random web creations by individuals who submit their projects to the list, and then you can click to see a random project by someone. Basically an art experiment in front-end web design and user interaction.

[Cameron's World](https://www.cameronsworld.net) - An epic trip down Geocities-era memory lane. Meticulously crafted anti-minimalism homepage made to look like a digital scrapbook of 90s GIFs and backgrounds, scattered with links to random archived Geocities homepages. Dig around, there's treasure galore.

[Wiby](https://wiby.org) - Search engine for personal websites, focussing on oldweb/indieweb style hobbyist/fan pages. Click the "surprise me" button to get some examples.

[Ooh.Directory](https://ooh.directory) - A directory of 2,000+ blogs collated in the style of early Yahoo, completely with categories/sub-categories, search, and "go to a random blog" functions. A personal project of a single person.

<a id="open-source-tools"></a>
## Open Source Tools

Not all made by individuals, but I feel like Open Source software is such an under-rated and under-known aspect of modern computing that it always needs more attention. Too many people still think "I need to edit photos? I'll get Photoshop", or want to learn games and go learn Unity without realising there's Godot, etc. These are a few of the open source tools that I use nearly every day and that manage to compete with massive companies while staying free and community-made.

[Godot](https://godotengine.org) - Pronounced "godot" (like "gif" is pronounced "gif"). Open-source and completely free to use, Godot is an impressively powerful game development engine that often gets buried under the shadows of the large commercial ones, and yet is fully capable of building release-level games, while being way easier to learn too.

[Blender](https://www.blender.org) - Most people who use computers have heard of Blender, but still very few understand how easy and fun it can be just to create "something". Follow a few tutorials and you'll be making incredible 3D art and/or animations in no time. It's easy to get daunted by what the pros are doing with it, but it's also just extremely fun to play around with for fun.

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - A complete competitor for Adobe Illustrator that is entirely free, Open Source, and runs on every OS. I have used Inkscape professionally and as a hobbyist for decades, and it just keeps getting better. Anything from physical print like flyers/posters, t-shirts, and stickers, through to digital vector art for websites and video games.

[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) - If you're using anything other than VLC to watch videos on your devices, you're doing it wrong. Stop wrestling with the horrible built-in video applications in your OS and just use VLC for everything. It plays every format you'll ever need, it converts, it plays music files and DVD rips, and it can stream digital radio stations. All for free.
